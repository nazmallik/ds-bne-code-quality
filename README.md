# ds-bne-code-quality

This repository contains a Makefile to check code quality via `black`, `flake8`, `isort` and `mypy`. 

The Makefile can also optionally run `nbqa` to run the above formatters, linters and static checkers on notebooks.

## Running 

Once you have `make` installed, you can run the code analysis tools via:

```shell
make
```
